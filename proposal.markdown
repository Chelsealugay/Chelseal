As part of the Create Caribbean internship program, we are required to submit individual projects, using the Digital humanities skills that we have acquired over the past several months. For my individual project, I have decided to map the places in which the Caribbean Literature pieces have been published. For this, I will include the Caribbean Literature pieces from the eras 1800-1830 and 2011-2022. I would create one map to represent each era. This would enable us  to compare the location of publication from what it was in the earliest era to this era. I have chosen this as my individual project because, firstly, I have a keen interest in geographic information systems(GIS) and mapping tools. Thus, by selecting this as my individual project, I expect to become more exposed to such tools and gain a better understanding of how they operate. I anticipate that on completion of this project I shall be better versed in the mapping tool I selected and its practical application. Secondly, I was assigned one of the earlier eras when that gathering the Caribbean Literature pieces, and observed that the literature published during this time was rather limited, however after contributing to the overall data spreadsheet, I saw how many more pieces were produced as the years went by, and I found this especially fascinating. This project will help me to visualize the  erasâ€™ publications and locations that these pieces were produced.  This project is expected to answer the following:
How has the wider world been included in the publication of Caribbean books over the years?
  How many Caribbean Literature pieces are currently being published compared to that of earlier years?
How has technological advancement aided in publishing records?
For this project I will be using ArcGIS as my mapping tool. ArcGIS is a geographic information system that enables users to analyze geographic information by visualizing geographical statistics. ArcGIS uses specific data and layers to create detailed maps. The layers are spatially placed so that a complex data map can be created. Using this tool, I would be able to create highly interactive maps that will aid in presenting the data that will be collected. 
Presentation of this data in this visual setting promotes understanding of otherwise complicated, seemingly unrelated data. This will be my form of visualization.
