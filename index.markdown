My name is Chelsea Lugay. I was born on the 25th of September in 2004. I am currently a first-year student at the Dominica State College, majoring in geography. I developed a passion for the subject from the first time I was introduced to it in High School. I completed my high school education at the Convent High School where I studied nine subjects. Some of my outstanding achievements include scoring five grade one’s in the CXC’s CSEC examinations. I aspire to use my love for geography as a geospatial scientist as well as to work in the tourism sector in Dominica. I enjoy cooking, hiking, engaging in outdoor activities, and spending time with friends and family. I consider myself to be very hardworking, determined, and always willing to do my best.
